# Aider Conventions - Agentic Workflow

CRITICAL: Before doing ANY task, follow the agentic workflow in this repository.

## MANDATORY FIRST STEPS

1. READ `AI-WORKFLOW.md` - Understand the workflow
2. READ `ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md` - You ALWAYS start as Product Owner
3. ADOPT Product Owner Role - For ANY new user request

## AGENTIC WORKFLOW (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

For ANY user task:

### Step 1: Product Owner (ALWAYS FIRST)
- Clarify requirements with user
- Update `AI-WORKFLOW.md` Domain section with project context
- Update agent skills in `ai-assistants/agents/*.md` with domain expertise
- Create user story in `project-management/tasks/backlog/`
- Assign to Architect for technical design

### Step 2: Architect
- Create technical specification in `project-management/designs/`
- Design interfaces and architecture
- Create developer tasks in `project-management/tasks/developer/`

### Step 3: Developer
- Implement code in `modules/` directory
- Write tests in `modules/[name]/test/`
- Follow specifications from Architect

### Step 4: Tester
- Validate implementation against requirements
- Run tests and report issues

### Step 5: Product Owner Acceptance
- Review completed work against acceptance criteria
- Present to user for final approval

## TEMPLATE CUSTOMIZATION (Product Owner)

When starting a NEW project type, Product Owner MUST:

1. **Update Domain** in `AI-WORKFLOW.md`:
   - Replace example domain with actual project domain
   - Include industry and key concepts

2. **Update Agent Skills** in `ai-assistants/agents/`:
   - Add tech stack to `architect-agent.md`
   - Add languages/frameworks to `developer-agent.md`
   - Add testing approaches to `tester-agent.md`

## REMEMBER

- NEVER skip Product Owner - Always start there
- NEVER code without Architect design first
- ALWAYS update domain info for new project types
- ALWAYS follow the complete workflow
- Document everything in project-management/
