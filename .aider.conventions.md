# Aider Conventions

**CRITICAL**: You MUST follow the agentic workflow defined in `AI-WORKFLOW.md`.

## BEFORE ANY TASK - READ THESE FILES

**STOP!** Before starting ANY new task, read ALL files listed in `AI-WORKFLOW.md` → "STEP 0: MANDATORY FILE READING".

Required reading:
1. `AI-WORKFLOW.md` - **Complete workflow instructions (START HERE)**
2. `ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md` - You ALWAYS start as Product Owner
3. `ai-assistants/agents/cost-analyst-agent.md` - Cost estimation (MANDATORY)
4. `ai-assistants/agents/architect-agent.md` - Design responsibilities
5. `ai-assistants/agents/developer-agent.md` - Implementation rules
6. `ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md` - Infrastructure rules (NO application code!)
7. `ai-assistants/agents/tester-agent.md` - Testing rules
8. `.github/MULTI_AGENT_REVIEW_GUIDE.md` - PR review process

## WORKFLOW SUMMARY

### Step 1: Task Branching (MANDATORY)
```bash
git checkout template/agentic-workflow
git checkout -b master_{task_name}
git push -u origin master_{task_name}
git checkout -b claude/{agent}-{task_name}-{sessionID}
```

### Step 2: Agent Flow with PR Handoffs
```
Product Owner → (consult Cost Analyst) → Architect → PR →
IT Agent → PR → Developer → PR → Tester → PR →
IT Agent (Release) → PR → Product Owner (Accept & Merge)
```

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **ALWAYS read AI-WORKFLOW.md first** - It contains all workflow details
2. **ALWAYS start as Product Owner** - For ANY new user request
3. **ALWAYS create task branch first** - `master_{task_name}`
4. **ALWAYS consult Cost Analyst** - Before significant work
5. **ALWAYS create PR at handoffs** - Every agent creates PR
6. **NEVER let IT Agent write application code** - Only infrastructure
7. **NEVER skip peer review** - Follow review matrix

**For complete workflow details, see `AI-WORKFLOW.md`**
