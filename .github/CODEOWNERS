# CODEOWNERS - Automatic Code Review Assignment
#
# This file defines code ownership for automatic GitHub review assignment.
# When a PR modifies files matching these patterns, the specified owners
# are automatically requested as reviewers.
#
# Pattern: path/pattern @owner1 @owner2
#
# Note: Since we use agent-based workflows with automated branch detection,
# this file serves as documentation of ownership rather than automatic assignment.
# The primary review assignment is handled by .github/workflows/pr-review-assignment.yml
