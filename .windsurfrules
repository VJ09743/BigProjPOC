# Windsurf Rules - Agentic Workflow

CRITICAL: Before doing ANY task, follow the agentic workflow in this repository.

## MANDATORY FIRST STEPS

1. READ `AI-WORKFLOW.md` - Understand the workflow
2. READ `ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md` - You ALWAYS start as Product Owner
3. ADOPT Product Owner Role - For ANY new user request

## AGENTIC WORKFLOW (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

For ANY user task:

### Step 1: Product Owner (ALWAYS FIRST)
- Clarify requirements
- Update `AI-WORKFLOW.md` Domain section with project context
- Update agent skills in `ai-assistants/agents/*.md` with domain expertise
- Create user story in `project-management/tasks/backlog/`
- Assign to Architect

### Step 2: Architect
- Create technical specification
- **Choose technology stack** (language, frameworks, tools)
- Design in `project-management/designs/`
- Create developer tasks
- **Hand off to IT Agent** for environment setup

### Step 3: IT Agent (AFTER Architect chooses tech stack)
- **Install dependencies** (npm install, pip install, etc.)
- **Update scripts/** folder (build.sh, test.sh, run.sh, clean.sh)
- Set up development environment
- Document in `project-management/operations/environment/`

### Step 4: Developer
- Implement in `modules/` directory
- Write tests

### Step 5: Tester
- Validate implementation
- Run tests

### Step 6: IT Agent - Release (if needed)
- Build release artifacts
- Package for distribution

### Step 7: Product Owner Acceptance
- Review completed work
- Present to user

## TEMPLATE CUSTOMIZATION

When starting a NEW project, Product Owner MUST:

1. Update Domain in `AI-WORKFLOW.md` with actual project domain
2. Add skills to agents in `ai-assistants/agents/` for the domain
3. Update project structure as needed

## REMEMBER

- NEVER skip Product Owner
- NEVER skip IT Agent after Architect chooses tech stack
- NEVER code without Architect design
- ALWAYS update domain info for new projects
- ALWAYS follow the workflow
