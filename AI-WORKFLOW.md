## MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**CRITICAL**: If you are an AI assistant (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, Aider, Cody, etc.), you MUST follow these instructions for EVERY user request:

### 0. ⚠️ OPTIONAL: LLM Provider Configuration (Only for Automated Reviews)

**LLM Provider is ONLY needed for automated peer reviews (GitHub Actions).**

**For IDE work ONLY** (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, Aider, Cody, etc.):
- ✅ **No LLM_PROVIDER needed** - Your AI tool authenticates separately
- ✅ **No LLM_API_KEY needed** - IDE handles authentication  
- ✅ **Start working immediately** - Skip provider setup

**For automated peer reviews**:

```bash
# Check if LLM_PROVIDER is set (ONLY needed for automated reviews)
if [ -z "$LLM_PROVIDER" ]; then
    echo "ℹ️  LLM_PROVIDER not set"
    echo "   • IDE work: ✅ Works fine (your AI tool authenticates separately)"
    echo "   • Automated reviews: ❌ Won't work"
    echo "   • To enable reviews: See quickstart/providers/ for setup"
else
    echo "✅ LLM Provider: $LLM_PROVIDER (automated reviews enabled)"
fi

# Check if LLM_API_KEY is set (only needed for automated reviews with non-Copilot providers)
if [ -n "$LLM_PROVIDER" ] && [ "$LLM_PROVIDER" != "copilot" ] && [ -z "$LLM_API_KEY" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: LLM_API_KEY is not set!"
    echo "This is required for automated peer reviews with $LLM_PROVIDER"
    echo "See: quickstart/providers/${LLM_PROVIDER}-setup.md"
elif [ "$LLM_PROVIDER" = "copilot" ]; then
    echo "✅ Using GitHub Copilot provider (no API key needed)"
elif [ -n "$LLM_PROVIDER" ] && [ -n "$LLM_API_KEY" ]; then
    echo "✅ LLM_API_KEY: Configured for automated reviews"
fi

# For Azure, also check endpoint
if [ "$LLM_PROVIDER" = "azure" ] && [ -z "$AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT is not set!"
    echo "Azure OpenAI requires both LLM_API_KEY and AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"
    exit 1
fi
```

**If you want to use automated peer reviews:**
1. **LLM_PROVIDER is REQUIRED** - Set to: openai, anthropic, gemini, azure, cohere, mistral, or copilot
2. **LLM_API_KEY is REQUIRED** - Except for `LLM_PROVIDER=copilot` (uses GitHub authentication)
3. **See**: [QUICK-START.md](QUICK-START.md#mandatory-choose-your-llm-provider) for setup

**If you're only using IDE tools (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, Aider, Cody, etc.):**
1. **LLM_PROVIDER is NOT needed** - Your AI tool authenticates separately
2. **LLM_API_KEY is NOT needed** - IDE handles authentication
3. **You can skip** the provider setup and start working immediately

**Environment Variables (Only for Automated Reviews):**
- `LLM_PROVIDER` - One of: openai, anthropic, gemini, azure, cohere, mistral, copilot
- `LLM_API_KEY` - Required except for copilot (uses GitHub authentication)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Only required if LLM_PROVIDER=azure

**Summary**: IDE work doesn't need LLM_PROVIDER. Only automated peer reviews need it.

### 1. Reading Order (NO CIRCULAR REFERENCES)

**This file (AI-WORKFLOW.md) is the single entry point.** Read agent files only when this workflow tells you to. Agent files contain role-specific content only — they do NOT redirect you back here.

```
Reading flow (one-way, no loops):

Tool entry file (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.)
    → AI-WORKFLOW.md (you are here — workflow, protocols, common rules)
        → ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md      (when adopting IT Agent role)
        → ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md (when adopting PO role)
        → ai-assistants/agents/cost-analyst-agent.md  (when adopting Cost Analyst role)
        → ai-assistants/agents/architect-agent.md     (when adopting Architect role)
        → ai-assistants/agents/developer-agent.md     (when adopting Developer role)
        → ai-assistants/agents/tester-agent.md        (when adopting Tester role)
```

**Rules:**
- Read each agent file **only when you adopt that role** in the workflow below
- Agent files do NOT send you back to this file — you've already read it
- All workflow, handover, and common protocols are HERE (not in agent files)

### 1b. IT Agent Runs FIRST
- Read `ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md` for role-specific instructions
- Verify & install `git` and `gh` CLI, authenticate `gh`
- This ensures all agents can branch, commit, and create PRs

### 1c. Then Start as Product Owner
- Read `ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md` for role-specific instructions
- Adopt Product Owner role for requirements gathering
- Never skip straight to coding

### 2. First Task? Customize the Template
**⚠️ MANDATORY FOR NEW PROJECTS**

When this is the FIRST task in a NEW project, Product Owner MUST:
1. **Read** `ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md` for detailed steps
2. **Update domain expertise** in ALL agent files (`ai-assistants/agents/*.md`)
3. **Commit changes** before creating user story
4. This ensures all agents have project-specific context for reviews and work

**Do NOT skip this step** - agents won't provide relevant guidance without domain expertise.

### 3. Follow the Agent Workflow
```
User Request → IT Agent (verify git & gh CLI)
    → Product Owner (requirements) → Cost Analyst (estimate cost)
    → Architect (design) → IT Agent (setup) → Developer (implement)
    → Tester (validate) → IT Agent (release) → Product Owner (accept)
```
**Cost Analyst** is advisory — consulted after Product Owner and before any expensive operation.

### 4. Never Skip Steps
Even for "simple" tasks, follow the workflow. This ensures quality and documentation.

## Agent System

This template uses a **multi-agent system** where the AI assistant adopts specialized roles based on the task. The agents work together through a structured workflow.

### Agent Roles

#### Product Owner Agent
**Role**: Customer-Facing Requirements Lead and Backlog Manager

- **⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Verify LLM_PROVIDER and LLM_API_KEY are set (see Step 0 above)
- **ALWAYS activates first** for new user requests
- Gathers and clarifies user requirements
- Creates high-level user stories (WHAT to build, not HOW)
- Coordinates work across all agents
- Accepts completed work

**Activates for**: Any new task from user, requirements, prioritization

**Note**: Product Owner focuses on WHAT to build. Technical details are filled in by Architect.

#### Architect Agent
**Role**: System Architect and Design Lead

- **⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Verify LLM_PROVIDER and LLM_API_KEY are set
- Enriches user stories with technical specifications
- Designs interfaces and APIs
- Creates detailed development tasks
- Makes architectural decisions

**Activates for**: New features, specifications, design, architecture

**Note**: Architect creates *technical specifications*. Product Owner creates *high-level requirements*.

#### Developer Agent
**Role**: Software Developer and Implementation Specialist

- **⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Verify LLM_PROVIDER and LLM_API_KEY are set
- Implements features and interfaces
- Writes clean, maintainable code
- Creates unit tests
- Follows specifications

**Activates for**: Implementation, coding, bug fixes, unit tests

#### Tester Agent
**Role**: Quality Assurance and Testing Specialist

- **⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Verify LLM_PROVIDER and LLM_API_KEY are set
- Creates test plans
- Writes automated tests
- Validates implementations
- Reports bugs

**Activates for**: Testing, QA, validation, bug reporting

#### IT Agent
**Role**: Infrastructure and Operations Specialist

- **⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Verify LLM_PROVIDER and LLM_API_KEY are set

- **Installs prerequisite tools** before project dependencies (see below)
- Maintains build infrastructure
- Manages releases and versioning
- Sets up CI/CD pipelines
- Documents infrastructure

**Activates for**: Build systems, releases, infrastructure, tools

**⚠️ IT Agent: Prerequisite Tool Verification (MANDATORY FIRST)**:

Before installing ANY project dependencies, IT Agent MUST verify and install the tools needed to perform those installations. This includes package managers, language runtimes, `git`, and `gh` CLI. See `ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md` for full scripts.

**Summary of what IT Agent does automatically:**

1. **Detects OS** (Linux, macOS, Windows)
2. **Detects/installs package manager**:
   - Linux: `apt-get`, `dnf`, `yum`, `pacman`, `apk`, `zypper` (all major distros)
   - macOS: Installs Homebrew automatically if missing
   - Windows: Uses `winget` if available, otherwise auto-installs Chocolatey
3. **Installs `git`** (required for version control, branching, commits)
4. **Installs `gh` CLI** (required for PR creation and the handover protocol)
5. **Verifies `gh` authentication** (prompts user to run `gh auth login` if needed)
6. **Installs project-specific tools** from Architect's tech stack (Node.js, Python, Rust, etc.)

```bash
# Quick reference - IT Agent runs these steps automatically:

# Step 0: Detect OS and package manager
OS_TYPE="$(uname -s)"  # Linux, Darwin, MINGW/MSYS/CYGWIN

# Step 1: Detect package manager (apt-get/dnf/yum/pacman/apk/zypper/brew/winget/choco)
# Step 2: Install git and gh CLI using detected package manager
# Step 3: Verify gh authentication
# Step 4: Install project-specific tools from Architect's tech stack
# Step 5: Final verification of all tools

# See it-agent.md for complete cross-platform scripts
```

**The general principle**: If a tool is needed to install project dependencies (e.g., `npm` needs `node`, `pip` needs `python`, `cargo` needs `rust`), IT Agent MUST install that tool first. IT Agent also installs `git` and `gh` CLI which are required for the workflow's branching and PR creation. Never assume tools are pre-installed on the user's machine.

#### Cost Analyst Agent
**Role**: Resource Analyst and Cost Optimization Specialist (ADVISORY)

- **Runs after Product Owner** creates the user story — estimates total task cost
- Estimates token consumption before expensive operations
- Warns user before high-cost tasks (> $1.00 requires explicit approval)
- Logs usage for transparency
- Recommends cost optimization strategies
- **Does NOT create PRs or deliverables** — reports estimates back to Product Owner/user

**Activates for**: After every user story (mandatory), before expensive operations (any agent can request), cost estimation, usage reporting

### Agent Workflow

**⚠️ EVERY agent MUST verify LLM provider configuration before starting work (see Step 0 above).**

The agents work together in a collaborative workflow:

```
User Request
    ↓
Read ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md → IT Agent (verify git, gh CLI)  ← FIRST
    ↓
[Optional: Verify LLM_PROVIDER & LLM_API_KEY — only for automated reviews]
    ↓
Read ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md → Product Owner (requirements)
    ↓
Read ai-assistants/agents/cost-analyst-agent.md → Cost Analyst (estimate cost)  ← ADVISORY
    ↓
Read ai-assistants/agents/architect-agent.md → Architect (design)
    ↓
Read ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md → IT Agent (install deps, setup scripts/)
    ↓
Read ai-assistants/agents/developer-agent.md → Developer (implement in modules/)
    ↓
Read ai-assistants/agents/tester-agent.md → Tester (validate)
    ↓
Read ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md → IT Agent (build release artifacts)
    ↓
Read ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md → Product Owner (accept & present)
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- **IT Agent runs FIRST**: Before any other agent, IT Agent verifies that `git` and `gh` CLI are installed and authenticated. Without these, no agent can branch, commit, or create PRs.
- **IT Agent activates THREE times**: First (git/gh setup), after Architect (project setup), and before Release (build)
- **Cost Analyst is ADVISORY**: Consulted after Product Owner creates the user story. Also consulted by any agent before expensive operations (> $1.00). Does NOT create PRs or deliverables — reports cost estimates back to Product Owner for go/no-go decision.
- **LLM Configuration Check**: Only needed for automated peer reviews, not for IDE work

### MANDATORY HANDOVER PROTOCOL (ALL AGENTS)

**CRITICAL: This is a BLOCKING GATE. Every agent MUST complete this before the next agent starts.**

When an agent finishes their work and is ready to hand over to the next agent:

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed to the next agent role yet
2. **Commit all work** to your branch: `git add -A && git commit -m "[Agent Name] Description"`
3. **Push to remote**: `git push -u origin {llm-agent}/{agent}-{task_name}-{sessionID}`
4. **Provide handover context** — the outgoing agent MUST document:
   - What was completed
   - Key decisions made and why
   - Any open questions or known issues
   - What the next agent needs to know
5. **Ask the user**:
   > "My work as [Agent Name] is complete. Before handing over to [Next Agent]:
   > - Would you like me to **create a PR** for review? (Recommended)
   > - Or should I **continue directly** to [Next Agent] without a PR?
   >
   > Creating a PR allows you to review my work before proceeding."
6. **Wait for user response** - Do NOT assume the answer
7. **If user wants PR**: Create PR using the [PR Creation Process](#pr-creation-process) below, then WAIT for user approval before proceeding
8. **If user says continue**: Proceed to the next agent role, noting that work is committed on the branch

**When the NEXT agent starts, it MUST** (see [Task Analysis & Collaboration Protocol](#task-analysis--collaboration-protocol)):
- Read the handover context from the previous agent
- Ask clarifying questions about anything unclear (**What**, **Why**, **How**, **Scope**, **Dependencies**, **Success Criteria**)
- The previous agent (or user) MUST answer these questions before work begins
- Document understanding and assumptions before starting work

**NEVER silently skip this step.** The user MUST be consulted at every handover.

**Why this matters**: Without this gate, agents skip PR creation entirely, breaking the review workflow. This was the #1 observed failure mode during testing.

#### Handover Points in the Workflow

| Completing Agent | Next Agent | Handover Gate |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| IT Agent (git/gh) | Product Owner | No gate — continue immediately |
| Product Owner | Cost Analyst | No gate — Cost Analyst reviews the user story |
| Cost Analyst | Architect | Reports cost estimate to user. If approved, continue to Architect |
| Architect | IT Agent (setup) | Ask user: PR or continue? |
| IT Agent (setup) | Developer | Ask user: PR or continue? |
| Developer | Tester | Ask user: PR or continue? |
| Tester | IT Agent (release) | Ask user: PR or continue? |
| IT Agent (release) | Product Owner | Ask user: PR or continue? |

**Note**: Cost Analyst can also be consulted mid-workflow by any agent before expensive operations. Any agent can request a cost estimate; Cost Analyst reports back to the requesting agent and the user.

### Task-Based Branching Strategy

When user gives ANY new task, Product Owner MUST first create a task master branch:

```bash
# Step 1: Create task master branch from template
git checkout template/agentic-workflow
git checkout -b master_{task_name}
git push -u origin master_{task_name}
```

**Examples of task master branches**:
- `master_joke-website`
- `master_user-authentication`
- `master_shopping-cart`

### Branch Naming Convention

| Branch Type | Pattern | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Task Master | `master_{task_name}` | `master_joke-website` |
| Agent Branch | `{llm-agent}/{agent}-{task_name}-{sessionID}` | `copilot/developer-joke-website-abc123` |

### Git Worktree Workflow

Agents work in separate git worktrees to enable parallel work:

```bash
# Product Owner creates task master branch first
git checkout template/agentic-workflow
git checkout -b master_{task_name}
git push -u origin master_{task_name}

# Then creates worktrees for agents (branching from task master)
git checkout master_{task_name}
git worktree add ../worktree-architect {llm-agent}/architect-{task_name}-{sessionID}
git worktree add ../worktree-developer {llm-agent}/developer-{task_name}-{sessionID}

# Each agent works independently in their worktree
# When done, create PR to master_{task_name} (the task's main branch)
```

### PR Creation Process

**⚠️ CRITICAL: When creating a PR (either because user requested it at handover, or at task completion), follow this exact process:**

```bash
# Step 1: Commit all changes
git add -A
git commit -m "[Agent Name] Description of completed work"

# Step 2: Push to remote
git push -u origin {llm-agent}/{agent}-{task_name}-{sessionID}

# Step 3: Create PR to task master branch (NOT main/master)
gh pr create \
  --base master_{task_name} \
  --head {llm-agent}/{agent}-{task_name}-{sessionID} \
  --title "[Agent Name] Work description" \
  --body "## Summary
[What was accomplished]

## Changes
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

## Ready for
[Next Agent Name]"

# Step 4: Verify PR was created
gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current)
```

**If PR creation fails**: Show the error to the user and ask for help resolving it (e.g., missing GITHUB_TOKEN, authentication issues). Note: `gh` CLI should already be installed by IT Agent in Step 0.

**REQUIREMENT**: Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable or `gh auth login` is configured before creating PRs.

### ⚠️ PR Checklist for ALL Agents

**When creating a PR, verify:**
- [ ] All files committed: `git add -A && git commit -m "[Agent] Description"`
- [ ] Branch pushed: `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
- [ ] PR created on GitHub: `gh pr create ...`
- [ ] PR has title: `[Agent Name] Description`
- [ ] PR body includes Summary, Changes, and Ready for field
- [ ] User informed of PR URL

### Peer Review Process (CRITICAL)

**All PRs must be peer-reviewed by other agents BEFORE user reviews.**

#### Review Assignment Rules

| PR Author | Required Reviewers |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Developer** | Architect, Tester |
| **Architect** | Developer |
| **Tester** | Developer |
| **IT** | Architect |

#### Review Checklist

Each reviewer checks:
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Design patterns correctly applied
- [ ] Tests are present and pass
- [ ] Documentation updated

#### Two-Phase Review

1. **Phase 1 - Peer Review**: Agents review each other (2+ approvals required)
2. **Phase 2 - User Review**: After peer approval, user reviews and merges

**NEVER skip peer review** - Quality before speed

---

## Task Management

### Task Folders

- `project-management/tasks/backlog/` - User stories (Product Owner)
- `project-management/tasks/it/` - Infrastructure tasks
- `project-management/tasks/architect/` - Design tasks
- `project-management/tasks/developer/` - Implementation tasks
- `project-management/tasks/tester/` - Testing tasks

### Creating Tasks

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to new file
2. Fill in objective, requirements, deliverables
3. Set status and priority
4. Tell your AI assistant to process the task

### Task Lifecycle

```
pending → in-progress → completed → archived
              ↓
           blocked
```

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Organize code into self-contained modules in `modules/`
- Each module contains:
  - `src/` - Module source code
  - `test/` - Module tests
  - `release/` - Release build output (gitignored)
  - `debug/` - Debug build output (gitignored)
  - `build-config/` - Build configuration files
  - `Makefile` - Module build script
- Copy `modules/example-module/` to create new modules

### Git Workflow
- **Base branch**: `template/agentic-workflow`
- **Task branch**: `master_{task_name}` (created per task, see [Task-Based Branching Strategy](#task-based-branching-strategy))
- **Agent branches**: `{llm-agent}/{agent}-{task_name}-{sessionID}` (created per agent from task branch)
- Always test before committing

### Testing Strategy

**Test Levels**:
1. **Unit Tests** (Developer) - Individual functions/classes
2. **Component Tests** (Tester) - Components in isolation
3. **Integration Tests** (Tester) - Component interactions
4. **System Tests** (Tester) - End-to-end workflows

---

## GitHub Integration

### Authentication - REQUIRED

**AI agents will automatically create PRs. You must set up GitHub authentication first.**

Before running any workflow, set up your GitHub token:

```bash
# Linux/macOS:
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"

# Windows (PowerShell):
# $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_github_token"

# Windows (CMD):
# set GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

**To create a GitHub token:**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `admin:repo_hook`
4. Copy the token and set it using the command for your OS above

### Automated PR Creation

Agents will automatically create PRs after completing their work. This requires:

- ✅ GitHub token set in `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
- ✅ `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- ✅ All commits pushed to remote branch

**If GitHub token is not set**: Agents will halt and request that you set it before continuing.

### Installing `gh` CLI (If Not Already Installed)

**Note:** IT Agent (Step 0) installs `gh` automatically. If you need to install manually:

```bash
# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gh

# Linux (Fedora):
sudo dnf install -y gh

# macOS:
brew install gh

# Windows (PowerShell):
# winget install GitHub.cli
# OR: choco install gh -y

# After installation, authenticate (all platforms):
gh auth login
```

**Verify setup (all platforms):**
```bash
gh auth status
```

### 1. Configure Your LLM Provider

Edit `ai-assistants/provider-setup/config.json` with your provider settings. See `ai-assistants/provider-setup/README.md` for details.

### 2. Update Domain Expertise

Edit each agent file in `ai-assistants/agents/` to include your project's domain knowledge.

### 3. Customize Project Structure

Modify the directory structure to match your project's needs:
- Add source directories for your modules
- Configure build systems for your technology stack
- Set up test directories appropriate for your frameworks

### 4. Configure Build System

Add build scripts appropriate for your technology:
- Makefiles for C/C++ projects
- package.json for Node.js
- requirements.txt for Python
- build.gradle for Java

### 5. Update GitHub Workflows

Modify `.github/workflows/` for your CI/CD needs.

## Notes for AI Assistants

- Automatically adopt appropriate agent role based on task
- Read agent file in `ai-assistants/agents/` **only when adopting that role** (not upfront)
- Follow peer review process before creating PRs
- Document decisions in appropriate project-management folders
- Keep this file updated when structure changes
- API keys are stored as environment variables, never in code

---

## Getting Started

1. **Configure your AI provider** (see `ai-assistants/provider-setup/README.md`)
2. **Describe your project** to the AI assistant
3. The AI will ask clarifying questions
4. Work begins with Product Owner analysis
5. Agents collaborate to complete the work
6. Review and merge PRs

**Example first request**:
"I want to build a web application for managing tasks. It should have user authentication, task creation, and notifications."

---

## Security Best Practices

- **Never commit API keys** - Use environment variables
- **Use .gitignore** - API keys and secrets are automatically excluded
- **Rotate keys regularly** - Especially if accidentally exposed
- **Use least privilege** - Only grant necessary API permissions

---

## Common Agent Protocols

**All agents MUST follow these protocols. Individual agent files reference this section instead of duplicating it.**

### Task Analysis & Collaboration Protocol

**CRITICAL — MANDATORY AT EVERY HANDOVER**: When an agent receives work from another agent (or from the user), it MUST follow this protocol BEFORE starting any implementation. The handing-over agent (or user) MUST answer the receiving agent's questions.

#### 1. Task Analysis & Clarification (MANDATORY)
When receiving a handover or new task, ALWAYS:

- **Read the handover context**: What did the previous agent complete? What decisions were made?
- **Read & Understand**: Carefully read the task description, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- **Ask Clarifying Questions** — the receiving agent MUST ask, and the handing-over agent/user MUST answer:
  - **What**: What exactly needs to be built/changed?
  - **Why**: What is the purpose and business value?
  - **How**: Are there specific approaches or constraints?
  - **Scope**: What is in-scope vs out-of-scope?
  - **Dependencies**: What does this depend on? What depends on this?
  - **Success Criteria**: How will we know this is done correctly?
- **Do NOT proceed until questions are answered** — if answers are unclear, ask again

#### 2. Document Understanding
Record in the appropriate `project-management/` subfolder:
- Task understanding and interpretation
- Key decisions and rationale
- Assumptions made
- Risks identified

#### 3. Think Critically Before Implementing
- **Identify Flaws**: Look for potential issues, edge cases, or problems
- **Suggest Improvements**: Propose better approaches or alternatives
- **Consider Trade-offs**: Analyze pros/cons of different approaches
- **Long-term Impact**: Consider maintainability and scalability

#### 4. Collaborate with Other Agents
- **Share Analysis**: Document findings and questions
- **Request Input**: Ask relevant agents for their perspective
- **Reach Consensus**: Ensure agreement on approach before proceeding
- **Document Agreement**: Record the agreed-upon approach

#### 5. Get Approval Before Significant Work
- Present the refined plan to the user
- Confirm understanding and approach
- Get explicit go-ahead

#### 6. Execute with Documentation
- Follow the agreed-upon plan
- Document significant decisions as you go
- Note any deviations from the plan and why

**Why this matters**: Without this protocol, agents make assumptions, build the wrong thing, or miss requirements. Asking clarifying questions catches misunderstandings early — before code is written.

### Before Concluding Any Task (ALL AGENTS)

**CRITICAL**: Before marking a task as complete, ALWAYS:

1. **Check for uncommitted changes**: `git status`
2. **Commit all work**: `git add -A && git commit -m "[Agent Name] Description"`
3. **Push to remote**: `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
4. **Follow the [Handover Protocol](#mandatory-handover-protocol-all-agents)**: Ask user about PR
5. **If PR created**: Verify it exists on GitHub and inform user of the URL
6. **Update task status**: Mark task as completed in the task file

### Branch Name Validation (ALL AGENTS)

Before creating a PR, validate your branch name:
```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

# Branch should match: {llm-agent}/{agent}-{task_name}-{sessionID}
# Examples: copilot/architect-login-page-abc123, claude/developer-api-xyz789
```

**Why this matters**: Automated peer review requires agent-specific branch names matching `{llm-agent}/{agent}-{task_name}-{sessionID}`. Generic branch names will cause peer review automation to skip the PR.
