# Claude Code Project Guide

## Project Overview

**BigProjPOC** is a proof-of-concept project organized into multiple large modules. This document provides context and guidelines for Claude Code to effectively assist with development.

## Modules

### BigModuleA
Purpose: [To be documented]
- Contains source code in `src/`
- Build outputs go to `build/`
- Release artifacts go to `release/`

### BigModuleB
Purpose: [To be documented]
- Contains source code in `src/`
- Build outputs go to `build/`
- Release artifacts go to `release/`

### BigModuleC
Purpose: [To be documented]
- Contains source code in `src/`
- Build outputs go to `build/`
- Release artifacts go to `release/`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep module code contained within respective `src/` directories
- Build and release directories are excluded from version control
- Maintain separation of concerns between modules

### Build Process
- Build artifacts should be generated in module-specific `build/` directories
- Release packages should be created in module-specific `release/` directories

### Git Workflow
- Main branch: `master`
- Feature branches: Use `claude/` prefix for Claude-generated work
- Always test changes before committing

## Claude Code Instructions

### When Creating New Features
1. Analyze existing code structure before making changes
2. Follow the established patterns in each module
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Consider impacts across all three modules if making architectural changes

### When Debugging
1. Check all three modules for related issues
2. Review build and release outputs if errors occur
3. Maintain consistency across modules

### Testing Strategy
[To be documented - add specific testing instructions here]

## Common Tasks

### Building the Project
[To be documented - add build commands]

### Running Tests
[To be documented - add test commands]

### Creating Releases
[To be documented - add release process]

## Notes for Claude

- This is a multi-module project - changes may affect multiple modules
- Build and release directories are working directories, not source code
- Maintain consistency in structure and patterns across all modules
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Use plan mode for complex, multi-step changes

## Project-Specific Context

[Add any additional context about the project domain, technologies used, specific requirements, or constraints that Claude should be aware of]
