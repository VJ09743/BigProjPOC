# Getting Started with AI Assistants

This guide helps you set up and use AI assistants for your software project.

## IMPORTANT: Automatic Workflow Enforcement

This template includes configuration files that instruct AI assistants to follow the agentic workflow:

| AI Tool | Config File | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Instructions for Claude Code CLI |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` | Instructions for Cursor IDE |

These files ensure the AI **always starts as Product Owner** and follows the complete workflow.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Provider

Pick one AI service to use:

| Provider | Cost | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | Pay per use | Best for software projects (recommended) |
| **Google (Gemini)** | Pay per use | Google ecosystem |
| **OpenAI (GPT-4)** | Pay per use | General coding |

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. **Anthropic**: Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. **Google Gemini**: Go to https://aistudio.google.com/ → Click "Get API Key"
3. **OpenAI**: Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Step 3: Configure Your Provider

```bash
# Copy the template
cp ai-assistants/provider-setup/config.template.json ai-assistants/provider-setup/config.json

# Set your API key (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence)
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Step 4: Install an AI Coding Tool

Choose one:

**Option A: Claude Code (Recommended - Best for software projects)**
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude
```

**Option B: Aider (Works with Gemini and OpenAI)**
```bash
pip install aider-chat
aider
```

**Option C: Cursor IDE**
Download from https://cursor.sh

## How the Agent System Works

When you interact with the AI, it will automatically:

1. **Start as Product Owner** - ALWAYS the first role for any request
2. **Customize the template** - Update domain info and agent skills for your project
3. **Adopt specialized roles** - Architect, Developer, Tester, IT as needed
4. **Follow the workflow** - Requirements, design, implement, test, release
5. **Create pull requests** - For your review before merging

### What Happens on First Request

When you give the AI its first task, the Product Owner will:
1. Update `AI-WORKFLOW.md` with your project's domain information
2. Update agent skills in `ai-assistants/agents/` for your project type
3. Create a user story documenting your request
4. Then proceed with the normal workflow

### The 6 Agent Roles

| Agent | What They Do |
|-------|--------------|
| **Product Owner** | Gathers requirements, creates user stories, coordinates agents |
| **Architect** | Designs systems, creates technical specifications |
| **Developer** | Writes code, implements features |
| **Tester** | Tests code, reports bugs, validates quality |
| **IT** | Manages builds, releases, infrastructure |
| **Cost Analyst** | Estimates token costs, warns before expensive operations |

## Example Conversations

### Building a New Feature

You say:
> "I want to add a login page with email and password"

The AI will:
1. Product Owner: Create user story with acceptance criteria
2. Architect: Design the login flow with technical specs
3. Developer: Implement the code
4. Tester: Validate it works
5. Create a PR for your review

### Fixing a Bug

You say:
> "Users can't save their profile changes"

The AI will:
1. Product Owner: Document the issue
2. Tester: Investigate and document the bug
3. Developer: Fix the issue
4. Tester: Verify the fix
5. Create a PR for your review
