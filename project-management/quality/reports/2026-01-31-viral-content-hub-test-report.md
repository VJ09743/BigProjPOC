## Issues Found

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **Live-server vulnerabilities**: The `live-server` dev dependency has some known vulnerabilities. This is development-only and doesn't affect the production build.

2. **GNews API key**: Using 'demo' placeholder. For production use, a real API key should be configured.

## Recommendations

1. Add unit tests using Jest for API modules
2. Consider adding E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
3. For production, get a real GNews API key or use alternative news sources
4. Consider adding a backend proxy to hide API keys

## Test Coverage

- **Build/Deploy**: 100% (all scripts tested)
- **Code Structure**: 100% (all files verified)
- **Functionality**: Pending (requires browser testing)

## Conclusion

**RECOMMENDATION**: Approve for acceptance review

The implementation meets all structural requirements:
- All 5 buttons implemented (Joke, Meme, Sports, Politics, Tech)
- Content safety filters in place
- Source attribution included
- Responsive design implemented
- Error handling present

## Next Steps

1. Product Owner acceptance review
2. Browser testing to verify functionality
3. Commit and push changes
