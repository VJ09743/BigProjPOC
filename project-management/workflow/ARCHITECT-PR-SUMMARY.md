# PR: [Architect] Technical Design & Task Breakdown - Sudoku Webapp MVP

## Summary

Complete technical design and task breakdown for Sudoku Web Application MVP.

## Changes

### Design Documents
- **EPS-001**: External Product Specification with features, workflows, and requirements
- **EDS-001**: External Design Specification with tech stack, API design, database schema, and algorithms

### Task Breakdowns
- **DEV-TASKS-001**: 8 developer tasks with dependencies, deliverables, and acceptance criteria
- **IT-TASKS-001**: 8 IT setup tasks including project structure, dependencies, database, and build scripts

## Tech Stack Selected
- **Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **API**: REST

## Key Deliverables

✅ API specification (REST endpoints)  
✅ Database schema with indexes  
✅ Sudoku algorithm design (puzzle generation, validation)  
✅ Task breakdown with dependencies  
✅ Developer and IT Agent task lists  

## Ready For
🚀 IT Agent setup phase  
→ Then Developer implementation
