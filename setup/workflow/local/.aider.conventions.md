# Aider Conventions - Agentic Workflow (Local Mode)

CRITICAL: Before doing ANY task, follow the agentic workflow in this repository.

## MANDATORY FIRST STEPS

1. READ `AI-WORKFLOW.md` - This is your primary reference for the complete workflow, protocols, and reading order
2. Follow the reading order defined in AI-WORKFLOW.md - It tells you which agent file to read at each step

## AGENTIC WORKFLOW (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

For ANY user task, follow the steps defined in `AI-WORKFLOW.md`. Summary:

1. **Product Owner** (FIRST) → Clarify requirements, create user story
2. **Cost Analyst** → Estimate total task cost, warn if expensive (advisory)
3. **Architect** → Technical design, choose tech stack
4. **IT Agent** (Setup) → Install prerequisites + project dependencies, set up scripts/
5. **Developer** → Implement in modules/
6. **Tester** → Validate implementation
7. **IT Agent** (Release) → Build artifacts
8. **Product Owner** (Acceptance) → Review and present to user

## MANDATORY HANDOVER PROTOCOL (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)

**At EVERY handover between agents, you MUST:**

1. **STOP** - Do not silently continue to the next agent
2. **Save all work** to disk
3. **Ask the user**:
   > "My work as [Agent Name] is complete. Before handing over to [Next Agent]:
   > - Would you like to **review my work** before I continue?
   > - Or should I **continue directly** to [Next Agent]?"
4. **Wait for user response** - Do NOT assume the answer
5. **If user wants review**: Present summary of work, wait for approval
6. **If user says continue**: Proceed to next agent

**NEVER skip this step. This is the #1 failure mode observed during testing.**

## REMEMBER

- Product Owner runs FIRST - For ANY new user request
- NEVER skip Product Owner
- NEVER skip IT Agent after Architect chooses tech stack
- NEVER code without Architect design
- ALWAYS follow the Handover Protocol at every agent transition
- ALWAYS read `AI-WORKFLOW.md` for complete protocols
- Document everything in project-management/
